Are there people who, for medical reasons, cannot wear surgical masks? Doctors
seem to agree that the answer is almost entirely 'no', with the possible
exception of people with extremely severe skin conditions.

Yet the idea of a medical exemption from face mask-wearing is central to the American mask dialogue.
On the left, people sternly suggest that you shouldn't attempt to police others'
mask-wearing, lest the non-mask-wearers suffer from invisible disability. 
On the right, the ''Freedom To Breathe Agency'' has had incredible success
selling fake ''mask exemption cards'', which say

> Wearing a face mask posses a mental and/or physical risk to me. Under the Americans with Disability Act (ADA), I am not required to disclose my condition to you...

Why has the vanishingly small class of medically-exempt people taken on such a large role
in the mask discourse? I see it as an example of the unreasonable success that narrow
''argument from the margin'' has in American rhetoric. 

I say 'unreasonable' both because I think Americans value the margin too highly
and because narrow argument from the margin is not the most coherent way of
applying value for the margin to policy. 

By narrow argument from the margin, I mean argument opposing an action X which 

1. Identifies a small group; 
2. Demonstrates that action X would harm that group;
3. Concludes that action X should not be done.


Popularity of narrow argument from the margin is, I think, closely related to
the popularity of identity
politics. If things can be good-for-Republican-texans or
good-for-POC-New-Yorkers, it's not a huge logical leap to say things can be
bad-for-those-medically-exempt-from-masks. 

Of course, another important intellectual relative of narrow argument from the
margin is John Rawls' Difference Principle:  

> **Difference Principle.**
> Social and economic inequalities are to.... be to the greatest benefit
> of the least-advantaged members of society.

That said, there's clear difference between narrow argument from the margin and the
Difference Principle. Narrow argument only calls for the speaker to identify *one*
less-advantaged group and *one* harm, but the Difference Principle calls for the
greatest *overall* benefit to *all** least-advantaged members of society. The
difference principle analysis of mask-wearing, for instance, has to analyse
the benefits and risks of policy towards those at risk of becoming severely ill too, which the narrow argument completely
ignores.

Maybe, translating back into the language of identity politics, the difference
principle is more *intersectional* than narrow argument from the margin.

So, here is my narrow objection to narrow argument from the margin: it's not
intersectional, it's not a society-wide analysis.  Let me acknowledge that this
objection is a little lazy, because of the computational issues inherent in a truly
society-wide analysis. But even if we can't effectively run society-wide
analysis, we can compute better than to the level of one problem and one group.
