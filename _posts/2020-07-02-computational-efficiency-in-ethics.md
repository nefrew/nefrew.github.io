An ethical theory, given a set of data, prescribes a best action, or a set of
ethical actions.

But ethical theories are not computationally efficient. That is, given some set
of  data, you
might have to do a lot of arguing and thinking to decide what actions an
ethical theory suggests are moral.

Deciding with high confidence whether an action is ethical or not within
some framework will often take much more time than one has to choose an action.

So how do people use ethical theories, in practise? Let me suggest that people
use *effective theories*: a set of rules-of-thumb and approximations which are
much easier to compute, but sometimes fail badly.

To be totally clear, I'm not talking about when people act irrationally or act instinctually: I'm
talking about when someone tries to think through a situation, but doesn't have
the time to do so as thoroughly as they would like. 

I think philosophers should be more interested in effective theories than they are. Because that's how
philosophy is used in practise. There could, for instance, be an ethical theory so hard to
compute that it just doesn't have a good effective theory. Or, two seemingly different
ethical theories could descend to very similar effective theories, in which case
the difference between the two would be academic.
